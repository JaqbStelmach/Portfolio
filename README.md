Hello! 
My name is Jakub, I am 24 years old and nearly one year ago I started continuously developing my skills as a software tester. I am a graduate of Academy of Phisical Education in Krakow, which I completed with 
a master's degree. My interests are mainly related to new technologies, artificial intelligence, economics, and business psychology.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in the area of the 5 most important (in my opinion) skills that every software tester should have:

1) Database testing and SQL
2) API testing - mainly ensuring safety and controlling updating and data migration 
3) English language - serves as a lingua franca in IT industry
4) Soft skills - enabling teamwork and effective communication
5) General knowledge of software testing - testers are obliged to know the terminology used and its execution
