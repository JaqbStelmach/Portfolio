Hello,
My name is Jakub, I am 24 years old, and nearly one year ago I have taken up developing my skills in software testing. I graduated from the Academy of Physical Education in Krakow with a master's degree. My main interests include modern technologies, artificial intelligence, economics, and football refereeing. To stay up to date with trends I continously develop 5 most important (in my opinion) testers' skills:

1) Soft skills
2) English
3) Databases testing and improving SQL langauge
4) Well-grounded knowledge in the wide scope of testing
5) API testing
